# 04 Frontend: structure and building blocks

> **Covers:** `src/ui/` and `src/i18n/` — the components the player sees, how they render, how they
> bind events, how they dispatch into `state/`, and how localisation works.
> **Does not cover:** game rules (Chapter 05) or state transitions (Chapter 06). If a fact is about
> *what the rule is*, it belongs in 05 even when the UI shows it.

## What this chapter must answer

- The list of UI components, one line each on what it does.
- How components interact, and how they are grouped.
- **One component in depth** — the most complex view, with its structure drawn out. The sample
  report does this with a single screen and it is one of its strongest sections. Pick the board
  renderer or the card-hand view, and put the component tree in the appendix as a text diagram.
- Modularisation: how the UI is split across files and why along those seams.
- How the UI reads state and dispatches intents — it never mutates state directly.
- Styling approach.
- Localisation: how i18next is set up, where the locale files live, how a key is resolved.
- Routing, if any. If there is none — a single-screen game — say so and explain why, rather than
  omitting the topic.

## Facts

*(Nothing yet — `src/` does not exist.)*

## Decisions

<!-- Promote decision blocks here from project-journal.md when this chapter is written. -->

## Open / to verify

- No source code exists yet. The layering below is the declared target state from
  [CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md), not an observed fact:
  `ui/` does jQuery rendering and event binding, reads state, dispatches intents into `state/`, and
  contains no game rules.
- Design and UI are developed with Claude Design; no design specification (colour palette, spacing,
  typography) exists in this repository yet. When it does, record where it lives — the report needs
  to reference it, and Chapter 12 will want the component overview table.
- A card's visual presentation belongs here and its rule belongs in Chapter 05; the two are matched
  by card id. Worth stating explicitly in the report, because it is the clearest example of the
  layering rule doing real work.
