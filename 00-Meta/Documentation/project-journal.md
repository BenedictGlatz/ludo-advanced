# Project journal

Append-only. Never rewrite an earlier entry — if something turns out to have been wrong, add a new
entry saying so and why. The value of this file is that it records what was believed at the time.

Three sections, each with its own rule:

- **Log** — one line per working session. What was done, which sprint, which issue.
- **Decisions** — one block per non-obvious technical or process decision. Raw material for the
  report's justifications, so it must include what was *rejected*.
- **Challenges** — anything that cost more than roughly 30 minutes of unplanned work. Feeds
  Chapter 11.

Dates are absolute (`YYYY-MM-DD`). No hour tracking — the team decided against it; plan-versus-actual
is tracked as scope and dates in [sprint-log.md](sprint-log.md).

## Log

- **2026-08-06** — Repository and GitHub project created. Sprint 0.
- **2026-08-06** — `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` written; stack fixed to
  JavaScript + jQuery + Vite + i18next, Vitest and Playwright for tests, ESLint and Prettier.
  Sprint 0.
- **2026-08-06** — Documentation notes established under `00-Meta/Documentation/`: steering index,
  13 chapter notes, this journal, sprint log, abbreviation list, and two adapted reference
  transcripts. `CLAUDE.md` extended with a documentation-notes section and a mandatory
  per-change step list. Sprint 0.

## Decisions

### 2026-08-06 — 2D web build instead of Unity 3D or Pygame

- **Chosen:** a 2D board game running in the browser.
- **Rejected:** a 3D approach in Unity — a new programming language for two of the three team
  members, plus asset creation and multiplayer work on top. Also rejected: 2D in Pygame, judged to
  offer less extensibility and a harder multiplayer path.
- **Why:** *"Because of the missing time (magical triangle), we decided to use a 2D board to be able
  to deliver more quality."* The scope was cut against the iron triangle deliberately and before
  implementation started.
- **Consequence:** the team works in a language it already knows, and the delivery risk moves from
  "can we learn the engine" to "can we finish the rules".
- **Source:** [Meeting Notes 20260806](../Project-Management/Meeting%20Notes/20260806.md),
  [00-One-Pager.md](../Project-Management/00-One-Pager.md).
- → Ch. 03, Ch. 11

### 2026-08-06 — Branching model is main/dev/feature, not GitHub Flow

- **Chosen:** `main` (always playable, no direct pushes) ← `dev` (integration) ← `feature/<issue>-<slug>`.
- **Rejected:** the GitHub Flow variant originally proposed in
  [Brainstorming.md](../../Brainstorming.md), with feature branches off `main` and no `dev`.
- **Why:** `main` is required to hold a working, playable build at all times. Merging feature
  branches straight into it makes that guarantee depend on every single PR being complete, whereas
  an integration branch absorbs partial work.
- **Consequence:** one extra merge step per release. The rest of the `Brainstorming.md` policy —
  no direct pushes to `main`, one review approval minimum, squash and merge, `Closes #<n>` — still
  applies.
- → Ch. 02

### 2026-08-06 — Documentation notes are kept per commit, not written at the end

- **Chosen:** a `00-Meta/Documentation/` directory of fact-only chapter notes, updated in the same
  commit as the change it describes. The report itself is written once, near the end, from the
  notes.
- **Rejected:** *writing the report at the end from the code and git history.* This is what the
  sample report the team is modelling on did, and its own Lessons Learned chapter names it as the
  project's biggest weakness — it produced time pressure at the end and the presentation was cut
  short to absorb it. Also rejected: *drafting real report prose continuously*, because every code
  change would then mean rewriting paragraphs, and the prose would be rewritten many times before
  anyone read it once.
- **Why:** the expensive part of a design decision to reconstruct three weeks later is not *what*
  was decided but *why*, and which alternative lost. Facts are cheap to capture at the moment they
  are true and cheap to re-sort into a different chapter structure later; prose is neither.
- **Consequence:** every change now owes facts to a chapter note and, if the reasoning was
  non-obvious, a decision block here. This is enforced through the mandatory per-change steps in
  `CLAUDE.md`. The cost is a few lines per commit; the benefit is that Chapter 11 can be written
  from a record rather than from memory.
- **Note:** the module's actual requirements are unknown — no chapter catalogue, page count or
  deadline exists. The 13-chapter structure is adapted from a sample report for a *different module
  with a different professor*, weighted toward project management because that is this module's
  focus. Keeping the notes prose-free is what makes a later re-map a re-sort rather than a rewrite.
- → Ch. 02, Ch. 10, Ch. 11

### 2026-08-06 — No hour-level effort tracking

- **Chosen:** a dated log of what was done, plus planned-versus-delivered scope per sprint.
- **Rejected:** logging hours per person per session, which is what the sample report's capacity
  plan is built from.
- **Why:** team decision. Hour logs that are not maintained honestly are worse than no hour log, and
  scope-and-dates is evidence that can be reconstructed from the board if a day is missed.
- **Consequence:** Chapter 11 shows plan against actual in scope and dates rather than in hours, and
  says so explicitly rather than leaving the absence of a capacity table unexplained.
- → Ch. 11

## Challenges

*(none yet)*

Log anything that cost more than roughly 30 minutes of unplanned work: what happened, what it cost,
how it was resolved. These become the running prose of Chapter 11, so a sentence of context is worth
more than a terse label.
