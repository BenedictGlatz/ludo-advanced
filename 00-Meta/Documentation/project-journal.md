# Project journal

Append-only. Never rewrite an earlier entry — if something turns out to have been wrong, add a new
entry saying so and why. The value of this file is that it records what was believed at the time.

Three sections, each with its own rule:

- **Log** — one line per working session. What was done, which sprint, which issue.
- **Decisions** — one block per non-obvious technical or process decision. Raw material for the
  report's justifications, so it must include what was *rejected*.
- **Challenges** — anything that cost more than roughly 30 minutes of unplanned work. Feeds
  Chapter 11.

Dates are absolute (`YYYY-MM-DD`). No hour tracking — the team decided against it; plan-versus-actual
is tracked as scope and dates in [sprint-log.md](sprint-log.md).

- **2026-08-06** — `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` written; stack fixed to
  JavaScript + jQuery + Vite + i18next, Vitest and Playwright for tests, ESLint and Prettier.
  Sprint 0.
- **2026-08-06** — Documentation notes established under `00-Meta/Documentation/`: steering index,
  13 chapter notes, this journal, sprint log, abbreviation list, and two adapted reference

## Decisions

### 2026-08-06 — 2D web build instead of Unity 3D or Pygame

- **Chosen:** a 2D board game running in the browser.
- **Rejected:** a 3D approach in Unity — a new programming language for two of the three team
  members, plus asset creation and multiplayer work on top. Also rejected: 2D in Pygame, judged to
  offer less extensibility and a harder multiplayer path.
- **Why:** *"Because of the missing time (magical triangle), we decided to use a 2D board to be able
  to deliver more quality."* The scope was cut against the iron triangle deliberately and before
  implementation started.
- **Consequence:** the team works in a language it already knows, and the delivery risk moves from
  "can we learn the engine" to "can we finish the rules".
- **Source:** [Meeting Notes 20260806](../Project-Management/Meeting%20Notes/20260806.md),
  [00-One-Pager.md](../Project-Management/00-One-Pager.md).
- → Ch. 03, Ch. 11

### 2026-08-06 — Branching model is main/dev/feature, not GitHub Flow

- **Chosen:** `main` (always playable, no direct pushes) ← `dev` (integration) ← `feature/<issue>-<slug>`.
- **Rejected:** the GitHub Flow variant originally proposed in
  [Brainstorming.md](../../Brainstorming.md), with feature branches off `main` and no `dev`.
- **Why:** `main` is required to hold a working, playable build at all times. Merging feature
  branches straight into it makes that guarantee depend on every single PR being complete, whereas
  an integration branch absorbs partial work.
- **Consequence:** one extra merge step per release. The rest of the `Brainstorming.md` policy —
  no direct pushes to `main`, one review approval minimum, squash and merge, `Closes #<n>` — still
  applies.
- → Ch. 02

### 2026-08-06 — Documentation notes are kept per commit, not written at the end

- **Chosen:** a `00-Meta/Documentation/` directory of fact-only chapter notes, updated in the same
  commit as the change it describes. The report itself is written once, near the end, from the
  notes.
- **Rejected:** *writing the report at the end from the code and git history.* This is what the
  sample report the team is modelling on did, and its own Lessons Learned chapter names it as the
  project's biggest weakness — it produced time pressure at the end and the presentation was cut
  short to absorb it. Also rejected: *drafting real report prose continuously*, because every code
  change would then mean rewriting paragraphs, and the prose would be rewritten many times before
  anyone read it once.
- **Why:** the expensive part of a design decision to reconstruct three weeks later is not *what*
  was decided but *why*, and which alternative lost. Facts are cheap to capture at the moment they
  are true and cheap to re-sort into a different chapter structure later; prose is neither.
- **Consequence:** every change now owes facts to a chapter note and, if the reasoning was
  non-obvious, a decision block here. This is enforced through the mandatory per-change steps in
  `CLAUDE.md`. The cost is a few lines per commit; the benefit is that Chapter 11 can be written
  from a record rather than from memory.
- **Note:** the module's actual requirements are unknown — no chapter catalogue, page count or
  deadline exists. The 13-chapter structure is adapted from a sample report for a *different module
  with a different professor*, weighted toward project management because that is this module's
  focus. Keeping the notes prose-free is what makes a later re-map a re-sort rather than a rewrite.

### 2026-08-06 — No hour-level effort tracking

- **Chosen:** a dated log of what was done, plus planned-versus-delivered scope per sprint.
- **Rejected:** logging hours per person per session, which is what the sample report's capacity
  plan is built from.
- **Why:** team decision. Hour logs that are not maintained honestly are worse than no hour log, and
  scope-and-dates is evidence that can be reconstructed from the board if a day is missed.
- **Consequence:** Chapter 11 shows plan against actual in scope and dates rather than in hours, and
  says so explicitly rather than leaving the absence of a capacity table unexplained.
- → Ch. 11

### 2026-08-06 — The board is read by making it public, not by authenticating

- **Chosen:** make the repository and the GitHub project public, and read the board through the
  unauthenticated REST API plus the board page's server-rendered JSON payloads.
- **Rejected:** *installing the `gh` CLI and issuing a token with `project` scope* — the correct
  long-term route, but it needs a token per team member and per machine, and nothing in the project
  needed writes yet. Also rejected: *the Projects v2 GraphQL API*, which is not a choice at all —
  it returns `403` to unauthenticated requests **regardless of project visibility**, so public
  visibility does not unlock it.
- **Why:** the immediate need was one read of the board to get sprint dates and the backlog into the
  notes. Public visibility is also independently useful — the deployment candidates in
  `Brainstorming.md` (GitHub Pages, itch.io) assume a public repository anyway, and a university
  project has no confidentiality requirement.
- **Consequence, and the part to state honestly in the report:** the working route parses GitHub's
  internal `memex-*` page payloads, which is **not a stable interface** and will break without
  notice. It is adequate for occasional manual reads and unsuitable as a foundation for tooling. If
  board data is ever needed *automatically* — a velocity chart generator, a burn-down script — that
  needs the `gh` CLI and a token, and the rejected option becomes the chosen one.
- **Also learned:** MCP servers are registered **per client**, not per editor. The GitHub MCP server
  was installed into VS Code's own registry and was therefore invisible to Claude Code running inside
  the same editor. See Ch. 07.

## Challenges

- **2026-08-06 — Reading the GitHub board took three attempts and two false leads.** The first
  attempt failed on four independent barriers at once (no MCP server visible to Claude Code, no `gh`
  CLI, no token, private repository), which made the cause hard to isolate — each one alone produces
  the same symptom. The second attempt failed in a more misleading way: the GitHub MCP server *had*
  been installed, so the reasonable conclusion was that it should work, but it had gone into VS
  Code's MCP registry rather than Claude Code's. Checking the config file directly rather than
  trusting "it is installed" is what resolved it. The board was finally read by parsing the page's
  embedded JSON, after confirming that Projects v2 GraphQL rejects unauthenticated requests even for
  a public project. Cost: roughly 30–40 minutes, most of it in the diagnosis rather than the fix.
  The lesson worth carrying into the report is that "the integration is installed" and "this
  particular client can see it" are different claims, and only the second one is testable.

Log anything that cost more than roughly 30 minutes of unplanned work: what happened, what it cost,
how it was resolved. These become the running prose of Chapter 11, so a sentence of context is worth
more than a terse label.
